## Background

Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV, or MERS) is a virus which affects the respiratory system. It has a fatality rate of around 35%. The virus was first discovered in 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Since then, there have been several outbreaks of MERS in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, an outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015, which is believed to have been brought there by a traveler from Saudi Arabia. The virus is known to have crossed over into the human population from camels, among which the disease is endemic. It is clear that the virus is not particularly virulent among humans, as the total number of infections over more than a decade amounts to several thousands. However, the very high fatality rate and possibility of spreading to other places, as it did in 2015, motivate interest in modeling the spread of this virus.

In this project, we perform analysis on MERS cases in Saudi Arabia from January 2014 to May 2016. We first analyze the data using ARIMA time series models, and then further explore the data with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model to simulate the spreading of MERS among camels population.
